# 🎬 IMDb Movie Ratings Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a beginner-friendly data analysis project that explores IMDb movie data.  
The goal is to analyze trends, ratings, genres, and other movie-related insights using Python.  
The analysis was done entirely in **Google Colab** using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.
